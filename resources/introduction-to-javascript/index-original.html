      <h1 class="margin-start-m">JavaScript</h1>

      <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
     
      ECMAScript , also known as JavaScript, is an incredibly versatile programming language used to introduce interactivity to web content. It has a wide range of applications, from webpage & app design to creating web games and artworks.
      Whilst it’s possible to use JavaScript for declarative programming, it’s primarily used as an Imperative language – where developers outline each step the computer must take to achieve the desired results.
      JavaScript is used for both client-side and server-side web development – so it’s a valuable language to learn!
      It’s also what we call an Object-oriented language. We’ll talk a bit more about that means later.

      <h2>JavaScript Versions & Standards</h2>

      <ul>
      <li>Like with the other languages we’ve covered already, JavaScript receives version updates that are released every year or so.</li>
      <li>You may have heard of ES6 – this version of JS came out in 2015. After this, versions were named by year (e.g. ECMAScript 2016, ECMAScript 2017, etc.)</li>
      <li>Some features available in newer versions may not work in older versions of web browsers. It’s wise to use a version that’s at least a couple of years old, unless you really need a specific new feature.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What we’ll need:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>A code editor</li>
        <li>A reference guide</li>
        <li>A little bit of prior knowledge of HTML and CSS</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The .js file</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Just like with CSS, JavaScript can be inserted straight into HTML using the &lt;scriptd&gt; tag, but it’s bad practice.</li>
        <li>Instead, create a .js file somewhere in your project directory, then add a link to it in your HTML within the &lt;head&gt; of the page.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>Number</li>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <li>Bigint</li>
        <li>Object</li>
        <li>Symbol</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>
        <li>Null</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>When we're programming, we inevitably come across values or data we'll need to use again later.</li>
        <li>We can store these bits of data to call upon in other parts of our script. We call these stored values Variables.</li>
        <li>There are 8 types of data available to us in JavaScript, and any of them can be made into a variable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Declaring a variable</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">let myName;
let myAge;
let isMarried;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that each line is ended with a
semicolon. All JS instructions should be written this way.</p>

<p>It’s good practice in JS for variable names to be written in camelCase.</p>
      

<ul>
  <li>We have to declare our variable in order to use it. We do this by using the let keyword, followed by our variable’s name.</li>
  <li>Unlike a lot of other programming languages, you don’t have to declare a variable’s datatype in JavaScript. That’s because we can switch a variable’s type whenever we like.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Initialising a variable</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">let myName = "Hannah-Louise"; 
let myAge = 29;
let isMarried = false;
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>Now we have variables, we need to give them values. This is what we call Initialising the variable.</li>
  <li>To make things easier, we can declare and initialise a variable at the same time, as shown here.</li>
  <li>You may have seen the var keyword used before to declare variables; this is an outdated keyword and it's never recommended for use.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Updating a variable</h3>

<pre><code class="language-js">let myName = "Hannah-Louise"; 
let myName = "Hannah-Louise"; 
myName = "Hannah";
myName = null;
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>Once we've initialised a variable, we can update it pretty easily simply by giving it a new value further down our code.</li>
  <li>Remember, JavaScript is very flexible with data types, so we can update our variable with a different data type if we need to.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Constants</h3>

<pre><code class="language-js">
const MY_NAME = "Hannah-Louise";
const namesList = ["Hannah", "Alex", "Adam" ]; 
namesList.push("Emily");
</code></pre>

<p>We’re using CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE for the string const above, but camelCase for the array const below. This helps remind us at a glance which constants cannot be altered throughout the code.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can also store data using a Constant instead of a variable.</li>
  <li>They're a bit like variables, but with a few major differences:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>You must initialise a constant when you declare it</li>
  <li>You can't give them a new value once you have initialised them</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Whilst you can't change the value of a constant, you can change the content of a value. Whilst that's not helpful for number or string constants, it is for Objects & Arrays.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding Comments</h3>

<pre><code class="language-js">let myName = "Hannah-Louise"; // Declare myName let myAge = 29;
let isMarried = false;
/*
the code below will
update the isMarried variable */
isMarried = true;
//myAge = 30;
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>We can add comments to help us make our script more readable and explain our code to others.</li>
  <li>We can also use it to prevent execution of code when troubleshooting or testing alternatives.</li>
  <li>We can make a comment over a single line using //. Anything written after this on the line will be considered a comment.</li>
  <li>For comments over multiple lines, we use /* and */ to signal the start and end of a comment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>console.log()</h3>

<pre><code class="language-js">let myName = "Hannah-Louise"; 
myName = "Hannah"; 
console.log(myName);
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>We can use the console.log() method to help us troubleshoot and monitor our code.</li>
  <li>Activating Developer tools in a web browser will bring up the console so we can see what's happening on the webpage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quick Practical</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In the script.js file, create a variable called myName, and initialise it with a value.</li>
  <li>Save your code and take a look how the greeting on our index.html page changes!</li>
  <li>Add in some comments to script.js to describe our code.</li>
  <li>Underneath your variable, re-assign myName and give it a new value.</li>
  <li>Now, change myName to a const.</li>
  <li>Open up developer tools in the browser to see the ReferenceError on our console.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Maths in JavaScript</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">let myInt = 7;
let myFloat = 24.62;

typeof myInt;
typeof myFloat;
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>At this stage, there's two main types of number we need to be aware of.</li>
  <li>Integers are whole value numbers (e.g. 1, 100, 365, etc.)</li>
  <li>Floating-point numbers (Floats) are numbers with decimal points and places (e.g. 1.5, 3.1415926, 6.9, etc.)</li>
  <li>Unless your number is extremely large, all your numbers will come under the number data type in JS.</li>
  <li>Number values are written without speech marks. Otherwise, JS will read it as a String!</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-js">let myInt = 7;
let myNumber = "7";
myNumber = Number(myNumber) + 5;

myNumber;
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>There are a huge number of different methods we can use with number values in JS.</li>
  <li>We can also convert other data values into number types using the Number() constructor.</li>
  <li>This is useful when converting values entered on web forms – which are strings – into numbers we can calculate with.</li>
  <li>In this example, if we did not convert myNumber, the result would be "75". Once we do, the output becomes 12.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The way we make calculations in JavaScript is by using Arithmetic Operators; most of these will already likely be familiar to you.</li>
  <li>The eModulo operator will divide the number on the left by the number on the right, returning the remainder value if the two numbers cannot be divided exactly.</li>
  <li>Exponent performs a exponentiation or 'to the power of' calculation, which raises the number on the left to the power of the number on the right. In our example, we raise 5 to the power of 2; 5 squared is 25.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Maths in JavaScript</h2>

  <pre><code class="language-js">let myNumber = "7";
myNumber = Number(myNumber) + 5;

myNumber;</code></pre>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

    <tr>
      <th>Operator</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>+</td>
      <td>Addition</td>
      <td>10+3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>*</td>
      <td>Multiplication</td>
      <td>10*7</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Modulo, or Remainder</td>
      <td>8%3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**</td>
      <td>Exponent</td>
      <td>5**2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Remember that the standard order of operation for mathematics still applies in JavaScript!</p>

<ul>
  <li>The way we make calculations in JavaScript is by using Arithmetic Operators; most of these will already likely be familiar to you.</li>
  <li>The Modulo operator will divide the number on the left by the number on the right, returning the remainder value if the two numbers cannot be divided exactly.</li>
  <li>Exponent performs a exponentiation or 'to the power of' calculation, which raises the number on the left to the power of the number on the right. In our example, we raise 5 to the power of 2; 5 squared is 25.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Increment/Decrement Operators</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">letnum=6;
num++; // returns value of num, then adds 1
num--; // returns value of num, then subtracts 1

++num; // adds 1, then returns the value of num 
--num; // subtracts 1, then returns the value of num
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>Increment operators are used to gradually increase or decrease a value.</li>
  <li>This can be useful when used as part of a loop, or to create a counter for conditional logic.</li>
  <li>The value your console will return will depend on whether you place the operator before or after your variable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment Operators</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">letnum=6;

num += 1; // adds 1, then updates the value of num
num -= 1; // subtracts 1, then updates the value of num 
num *= 2; // multiplies by 2, then updates the value of num 
num /= 2; // divides by 2, then updates the value of num
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>Assignment operators, unsurprisingly, assign a value to a variable. The most basic is =, which we've seen a lot of already.</li>
  <li>The more complex operators are useful shorthand to keep our code neat and save time. Instead of writing x = x + 5; , we can just write x += 5.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Operator</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>===</td>
      <td>Strict equality</td>
      <td>Tests whether left and right values are identical</td>
      <td>5===4+1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>!==</td>
      <td>Strict non-equality</td>
      <td>Tests whether left and right values are not identical</td>
      <td>5!==4+2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;</td>
      <td>Less than</td>
      <td>Tests whether the left value is smaller than the right one</td>
      <td>5&lt;10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&gt;</td>
      <td>Greater than</td>
      <td>Tests whether the left value is greater than the right one</td>
      <td>5&gt;3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;=</td>
      <td>Less or equal to</td>
      <td>Tests whether the left value is smaller or equal to the right one</td>
      <td>5&lt;=6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&gt;=</td>
      <td>Greater or equal to</td>
      <td>Tests whether the left value is greater or equal to the right one</td>
      <td>5&gt;=4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>Sometimes, we will need to run a true/false test between values, and carry out actions based on the result.</li>
  <li>This is where Comparison operators come in. These will return a Boolean value of true or false which you can use elsewhere in your code.</li>
  <li>With these operators, we can begin to start thinking about introducing logic into our scripts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If... else Statements</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">if (weather === "raining") {
  /* code to run if condition is true */
  console.log("It’s raining. Best not put out any washing."")
} 
else {
  /* run some other code instead */
  console.log("It’s dry outside! Time to put out the washing."); 
};
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>As we just discussed, sometimes we want to make decisions in our code based on a condition. For example, I only want to dry laundry outside if it isn't raining.</li>
  <li>If...else statements look to see if an expression you specify returns as true. If it does, it executes one block of code; if not, it executes a different block.</li>
  <li>We can also nest if...else statements if we wish to create several layers of choice – kind of like a dialogue tree in a video game.</li>
</ul>

<h2>else if</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">if (weather === "raining") {
  /* code to run if condition is true */
  console.log("It’s raining. Best not put out any washing.");
}
else if (weather === "snowing") {
  console.log("It’s snowing! Washing won’t dry outside today.")
} else {
  /* run some other code instead */
  console.log("It’s dry outside! Time to put out the washing.");
};
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>If...else statements on their own give us only two options to choose from. But what if we need more?</li>
  <li>We can use else if to add additional conditions into our If...else statement.</li>
  <li>Since JavaScript runs from top to bottom, order is important – else if sits after the if action but before the else keyword.</li>
  <li>We can add as many else if conditions into our statement as we like.</li>
  <li>Once the computer finds one of the statements true, it will not check any of the ones following it.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-js">if (isRaining || isSnowing) {
  console.log("The weather is bad. Best not put out any washing.");
}
else if (!(wind < 40)) {
  console.log("It’s very windy! Your washing might blow away.");
}
else if (weather === "sunny" && wind >= 25) {
  console.log("Sun and a breeze! Perfect day for drying washing.")
} 
else {
  console.log("It’s dry outside! Time to put out the washing.");
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Logical operators allow us to create more complex logic by testing more than one condition at a time.</li>
  <li>The AND operator (&&) chains multiple conditions together. All the conditions must be true for the whole expression to return as true.</li>
  <li>The OR operator (||) also chains together conditions, but only one of the conditions needs to be true for the whole expression to be true.</li>
  <li>Finally, the NOT operator (!) negates all the conditions. The expression will only return as true if none of the individual conditions are true.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ternary Operators</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">let isRaining = true;
isRaining ? console.log("It’s Raining") :
console.log("It’s not raining");
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>There's one last operator to introduce: the Ternary Operator.</li>
  <li>This operator allows us to test a condition, returning one of two expressions based on whether our condition is true or false.</li>
  <li>It's a useful tool for simple conditional tests, as it takes up a lot less code than a full if/else statement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Switch Statements</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">let weather = "sunny";
switch (weather) {
  case "sunny":
  console.log("It’s sunny outside! Don’t forget your sun cream and sunglasses!");
  break;

case "snow":
  console.log("It’s snowing! Don’t forget your scarf and gloves!");
  break;

case "rain":
  console.log("It’s raining! Don’t forget your coat and umbrella!");
  break;

default:
  console.log("It’s pretty normal outside today – take a jacket, just in case!");
};
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>If...else statements are brilliant for a lot of purposes, but the syntax can be a bit bulky when you have a large number of options for a pretty simple condition.</li>
  <li>That's where Switch Statements can help us out. Switch statements can take a single expression and compare it against multiple options until it finds one to match, executing the associated code.</li>
  <li>The break keyword is used to ensure that the switch statement stops looking for matching conditions once it finds one.</li>
  <li>The default option is used if none of the other cases match the expression.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functions vs. Methods</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">// Define a string variable
let str = "It’s too early for teaching";

// Use methods to affect that string object
let str1= str.toLowerCase(); 
let str2= str.toUpperCase();

/* Defining our function using an expression statement, creating a const variable */
const iAmTired = function() {
 console.log("It’s too early for teaching");
}
// Calling the function
iAmTired();
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>So far we've seen a few examples of JS' inbuilt Methods – sets of instructions that perform specific tasks for us.</li>
  <li>What's important to note is that methods are associated with an Object – you can't have the console.log() method without the 'console' object, for example.</li>
  <li>If we want to create a set of instructions we can re-use, without having to connect them to a specific object, we need a Function.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Defining a function</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">/* A function declaration – we give our function a name and then describe it */
function quickMaths (a, b) {
  return a * b; 
};

/* A function expression – an anonymous function is stored in a variable */
const quickMaths = function (a, b) {return a * b}; 
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>Before we use a function, we have to define it – basically, explain what it does.</li>
  <li>Let's look at two ways to define a function: Function Declarations and Function Expressions.</li>
  <li>Both of these examples share 2 things: the function keyword, and arguments, enclosed in parentheses. With function expressions, we don't have to give our function a name.</li>
  <li>Arguments are data values that are used inside the function. We can define those values when we invoke the function later!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Invoking a function</h2>

<pre><code class="language-js">/* invoking a declared function*/
function quickMaths (a, b) { 
  return a * b;
};
quickMaths (5, 8);

/* A function expression – an anonymous function is stored in a variable */
const quickMaths = function (a, b) {return a * b};
let answer = quickMaths(5, 8);
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>Once we've defined a function, we can choose to invoke it whenever we like. Once a function is invoked, the code inside will execute.</li>
  <li>It's at this point that you can add your arguments into the parentheses: here we've replaced a and b with 5 and 8.</li>
  <li>If you've used a function expression, you can then use the variable as a function in a wider context. Here, we're initialising a new variable, <code>answer</code>, using <code>quickMaths</code>.</li>
</ul>
