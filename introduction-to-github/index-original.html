      <h2>What is Git?</h2>

      <p>
        Git is what we call a distributed version control system. It's used by
        programmers to store and back up their work, track changes, and work
        collaboratively within teams. It works by taking an online repository of
        code (inc. its full history), and cloning it. These parallel copies are
        then stored on each developer's computer for them to work on.
      </p>

      <h2>How Git works</h2>

      <p>
        Git works by allowing you to branch off from the main repository,
        isolating and tracking any changes you make without affecting the main
        codebase.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you save those changes to your branch, it's called a
        <strong>commit</strong>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Eventually, you can push your commits to the online repository, where
          others can view your branch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your changes can then be reviewed and merged into the main codebase.
          Merging changes is known as a <strong>pull</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also fetch updates others have made, and review them before
          pulling them into your branch.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Git in the terminal</h2>

      You're probably all familiar with Github by now – but that's just an
      online hosting platform that uses Git to work. You can actually use Git
      directly from the command line, if you want to. Many versions of MacOS
      come with Git pre-installed: type git version into the terminal to check
      if you have it!

      <h2>Github Desktop</h2>

      <p>Here’s where you’ll find your recently accessed repositories</p>
      <p>If we need to work in a new repo, we’ll add it here</p>

      <h2>We can choose to clone a repo:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Directly from a given URL</li>
        <li>From any of the existing repos</li>
        <li>connected to our Github account</li>
        <li>From a local file on our computer</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Let’s clone the following repo from the internet: [Add repo here]</p>


      <p>
        Now we’ve cloned our repo, we can open it in our file explorer, or edit
        it in VSCode. Let’s open it in VSCode and make a change.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the top toolbar, you can change your repository, change or create new
        branches, and fetch updates for your repo.
      </p>

      <p>
        On this side, Github will log changes you make to files in your
        repository.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the main workspace, you can see your code and the changes made to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we’re ready to submit our changes, we can commit them from the
        bottom-left hand corner. It’s good practice to be clear and as
        descriptive as possible when writing up commits.
      </p>

      <h2>Forks</h2>

      <p>
        If we’ve cloned a repo we don’t have permission to make changes to, we
        have the option to create a fork. A Fork creates a new repository that
        shares code and visibility with the original. With a fork, we can use
        someone else’s repo as a starting point for our own ideas.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating a New Repo</h3>

      <p>
        Now, let’s create a repository from scratch using our website files
        we’ve been working on.
      </p>

      <h2>Github Pages</h2>

      <p>
        Github’s Pages feature allows us to host a website from a public
        repository of our choice. We can configure this in the settings for our
        repo page once we’ve published it.
